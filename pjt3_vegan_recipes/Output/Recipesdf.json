Spread over a layer of the buttercream, using a palette knife to get an even, neat finish. Top with the second sponge and spread over another layer of buttercream.\",\"8. Top with the last sponge upside-down, so the bottom of the cake becomes the top (this will help to keep the icing neat and relatively crumb-free). Spread the sides of the cake with buttercream. Hold the top sponge steady with a palm if you need to stabilise the cake. Once you have the sides covered as neatly as you can, cover the top with a thin layer of buttercream. Use your palette knife to neaten the top and sides. If you have a side scraper, use it to sweep around the sides and top to sharpen the coating. (This is a crumb coat, trapping any crumbs to give you a neat, firm base.) Put the cake in the fridge to firm up and chill for 1-2 hrs.\",\"9.

Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm spot, for 60 minutes, until it has doubled in size. If using active dry yeast, rising time will take twice as long.\",\"3. In the meantime, beat the egg and set aside. Mix the sugar, cinnamon and cardamon and place in a small bowl.\",\"4. Divide the dough into four equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, cover the balls, and allow them to rest for 15 minutes.On a floured surface, roll one piece of dough into a 10\u2033 circle. Place the circle on a parchment -lined sheet pan, brush a thin coat of beaten egg on the surface, then evenly sprinkle with a third of the spiced-sugar, \u00bc cup dried cranberries, \u00bc cup almonds, leaving 1\/4 inch of bare dough around the edges.\",\"5. Roll out a second circle the same size as the first, and place it on top of the filling-covered circle. Repeat the layering process: egg, spiced sugar, cranberries, almonds, then roll out the 3rd dough circle, add the remaining filling. Roll out the final ( 4th )dough circle, placing it on top, leaving the top totally bare.\",\"6. Place a 2 1\/2\u2033 to 3\u2033 round cutter ( or cup) in the center of the dough circle to use as a guide. With a sharp knife, cut the circle into 16 equal strips, from the edge of the cutter or cup- to the edge, through all the layers. Look at the photos. \\uD83D\\uDE42\",\"7. Using two hands, pick up two adjacent strips and twist them away from each other twice so that the top side is facing up again. Repeat with the remaining strips of dough so that you end up with eight pairs of strips. ( see photos)\",\"8. Pinch the pairs of strips together to create a star-like shape with eight points. Remove the cup\/cutter.\",\"9. Cover the star with a thin towel and let it rise until itpuffs, about 45 minutes.\",\"10. While the star is rising, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.\",\"11. Brush the star with a thin coat of the beaten egg.

Trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife and patch any holes with the cut-off excess. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin \u2013 you do not need to worry about overworking the pastry as it contains no gluten.\",\"7.

Once the mixture is uniform and there are no large lumps left (to check, shake the bowl lightly, they will come to the surface), rub the small bits of oil into the flour with your fingers until there are no lumps left. Yes, I know, it does take some time!\",\"4. Finally add in ice cold water and mix it into the flour mixture with a cutlery knife to distribute the water evenly. The exact amount of water needed depends on the absorbency of your flour but start off with 15-30 ml \/ 1-2 tbsp and add a tiny bit more at a time, if needed \u2013 too much water makes more a tough pastry.\",\"5. To check if more water is needed, grab a handful of mixed dough with your hands, if it is very dry, add a little more water, mix it in and check again.\",\"6.

I used these mini tart cases so I used 8 cm \/ 3.15\u2033 round cookie cutters to make the circles of dough to line the moulds with. Once I lined them with pastry, I trimmed them to size using a sharp knife. You could also make them in a standard 12-hole muffin tin. If that\u2019s what you have, use a large cookie cutter (I used my biggest 10 cm \/ 4\u2033 circle) to cut a neat circle out of the pastry and line the muffin hole with it.\",\"10. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the edges and making sure there is no air bubble underneath the pastry. The pastry won\u2019t quite reach the top of the muffin hole but that\u2019s okay. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin \u2013 you do not need to worry about overworking the pastry as it contains no gluten.\",\"11.

Start off with 3 tbsp of plant milk, add the 4th one later (if needed).\",\"2. Add about half of the drained and rinsed cashews. Blend until smooth, adding more cashews as the mixture gets thicker and thicker.\",\"3. At some point, the mixture will become very thick and heavy and your blender may struggle to turn. To remedy this, start making circles on the surface of your mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula to prevent air pockets forming under the mixture\u2019s surface. Be careful not to dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades. If you follow the technique I\u2019ve described above, there is enough moisture in this recipe not to have to use any more liquid, which means you\u2019ll end up with a smooth, creamy and thick frosting.\",\"4. The mixture will thicken a little after it\u2019s been well refrigerated but to be able to pipe it, I recommend adding agar agar as a firming agent. Activate agar agar according to the instructions on the packet. I recommend using powder as it\u2019s 3 times more potent than flakes and easier to activate \u2013 you need to rehydrate it in liquid (almond milk in this case) for 10-15 minutes first before bringing to the boil. Flakes need a lot of simmering and I found that they never fully dissolve.\",\"5. Once activated, add agar agar to the frosting and blend well and then give it another blend before putting it into the piping bag so that you break any lumps. I like to transfer it to a bowl and give it a really good whisk with a wire whisk to make sure the icing is smooth before I put it into my piping bag.\"]}]","recipe_id":1918,"serving":"serves 12","time":"21 min","title":"Vegan carrot cupcakes with cashew frosting","total_fat":"13 g"},"202":{"calories":"321 kcal","carbs":"31 g","category":"4.West+Etc","image":"https:\/\/cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/vegan-cauliflower-mash-balsamic-beetroots-800x1200.jpg","ingredients":"[450 g \/ 1 lb cauliflower florets (1 medium cauliflower), 1-2 tbsp olive oil, 1 head of garlic, 450 g \/ 1 lb raw beetroot, \u00bd tsp salt, more to taste, 120 ml \/ \u00bd cup almond (or other neutral tasting) milk, 60 ml \/ \u00bc cup roasted walnut butter, shop-bought or see below, 30 ml \/ 2 tbsp lemon juice or apple cider vinegar, black pepper, to taste, \u00bd tsp ground cumin (optional), 2 tbsp balsamic glaze \/ reduction, shop-bought or see below, roasted walnuts, to garnish, fresh thyme leaves,to garnish, 200 g \/ 2 cups walnuts, 4 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 2 tbsp maple syrup or sugar, adjust to taste]","link":"https:\/\/www.lazycatkitchen.com\/vegan-cauliflower-mash-balsamic-beets\/","pk":1919,"protein":"9 g","recipe":"[{\"\":[\"1.

Keep going until the dough is moist enough that it can be brought together by hand \u2013 clump a bit of mixture with your hand, if it sticks together (without being wet!) you\u2019ve added enough water. I ended up using \u00bc cup plus 2 tsp of water, but please go through the process as I described above instead of just adding the amount I added as different flours have different absorbency levels.\",\"4. Empty your bowl (or a food processor bowl) onto a work surface and bring all the dough together using your hands, but do not knead if you are working with gluten flour (overworking the dough will make the pastry tough). Form the dough into a flattened disc and refrigerate for at least 30-45 minutes.\",\"5. Gently and slowly roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface. You may want to do it between two sheets of baking paper as it stops the dough sticking to the bench. When it comes to gluten-free dough, you may find it easier (I did) to simply mould it to the inside of the tart tins with your fingers.\",\"6. Roll the dough into a large circle 2 cm \/ 1 inch bigger than the pie dish (I used a 24 cm \/ 9.5\u2033 diameter pie dish). Roll the dough sheet over the rolling pin, place the rolling pin over the pie dish and unroll it gently. Line the dish and fold any excess you get at the edges under so that you end up with thick edges. Then go over the edge and crimp the edges by interlocking your index and middle finger on one hand against the index finger of your other hand (see photo). Pierce the bottom in several places with a fork.\",\"7. Heat up the oven to 160\u00b0 C \/ 320\u00b0 F fan forced (180\u00b0 C \/ 355\u00b0 F no fan) and place your pie in the freezer (or fridge, but freezer is better) for another 15 minutes or so.\",\"8. Remove the pie dish from the freezer, place a piece of baking paper (scrunch it up first to make it more flexible) at the bottom of the dish and fill with baking beads (or dry beans). Blind bake for 10-15 minutes.\",\"9. Carefully remove the beads and the baking paper insert and return the pie to the oven for another 10 minutes.

If you don\u2019t have a tin the right size, do not worry, use a large baking tray \u2013 this pie is pretty self-contained.\",\"2. To assemble the pie, clear a large area of your work bench to make room for a long row of pastry sheets joined together. Keep the thawed pastry sheets protected by a damp kitchen towel so that they do not dry out and become brittle.\",\"3. Place a rectangle of pastry in front of you, making sure the longer side is parallel to you. Then place another rectangle to its right overlapping the ends by 5 cm \/ 2 \u201c. Follow up with the third sheet arranged in the same manner. You should end up with a very long rectangle of pastry.\",\"4. Using a pastry brush, quickly grease the entire area with a bit (not too much) olive oil and double all the pastry sheets overlapping them in the same manner.\",\"5. Follow up with another layer of pastry (if you want and have enough pastry sheets, it\u2019s not necessary).\",\"6. Brush the entire area with a little bit of oil again before arranging the filling on top.\",\"7. Put a long snake of filling along the longer edge of the pastry leaving a 5 cm \/ 2\u2033 margin at the bottom. Try to make the filling amount the same everywhere.

Set aside.\"]},{\"CHEESECAKE LAYER\":[\"1. Rinse the cashews and chop them roughly. If you own a very powerful blender (like a Vitamix or Blendtec) this step may be completely redundant, but with my low range (and fairly old) blender this is the only way I can achieve smooth consistency without adding too much liquid.\",\"2. Divide the chopped cashews into roughly six portions. Chuck one sixth of the chopped cashews into a blender with all of the coconut cream, half of the lime juice and maple syrup. Process until super smooth.\",\"3. Once smooth, add another sixth of the chopped cashews. Process until smooth and repeat until you\u2019ve used up all of the cashews. Towards the end, the mixture will become very thick and heavy and your blender may struggle to turn. To remedy this, start making circles on the surface of your mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula to prevent air pockets forming under the mixture\u2019s surface. Be careful not to dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades. If you follow the technique I\u2019ve described above, there should be enough moisture in this recipe (from coconut cream, lime juice and maple syrup if using) not to have to use any water, which means you\u2019ll end up with a smooth and creamy cheesecake mixture.\",\"4. Adjust the amount of lime juice to taste and season the mixture with freshly grated ginger. I like a strong taste of ginger so I used a lot of it, but I recommended you adjust the amount to your taste.

Add a splash of water (or brandy if you like) to the apples and let them cook gently, on a low-medium heat, until they become soft and cooked through. Once ready, they will become less opaque.\"]},{\"CARAMEL SAUCE (SUGAR VERSION)\":[\"1. Spread an even layer of sugar at the bottom of a dry pan or pot. Heat up the sugar on a medium heat (I used setting 3 out of 6). Refrain from stirring it, although if your pan has hot spots, you may need to gently manoeuvre the unmelted sugar into a hot spot. Meanwhile, warm up \u00bd cup of coconut milk in a separate pot.\",\"2. Once all the sugar has melted, let the sugar caramelise and darken slightly (it will happen quite quickly so be careful not to burn it). The darker the caramel, the less sweet it will be. Once the sugar achieves the colour you are after, take the pan off the heat and slowly stir in the warmed up coconut milk and then add salt. Be very careful as even though warming milk up minimises this, caramel may be splattering at this point and it will be very hot.\",\"3. There is a chance that once you add the coconut milk, some of the caramel will harden into big lumps. What you need to do is to return the pan to the stove and set on a very low setting (I used 2 out of 6) to allow these lumps to melt away. Make sure you keep on stirring the mixture. Now, because the longer you cook your caramel sauce the more sticky and less sauce-like it will become, if you do need to bring it back to the stove to melt any stubborn lumps, add another \u00bc cup \/ 60 ml of coconut milk to the pan to ensure that once your lumps have dissolved the caramel will retain sauce consistency. Do not panic if it appears to be too runny at first, caramel thickens as it cools down. If it does end up being too runny, place the pan back on the stove and reduce the caramel gently to thicken the sauce.\"]},{\"CARAMEL SAUCE (HEALTHIER ALTERNATIVE)\":[\"1. Slowly heat up maple syrup in a pan. When it starts to boil gently, take it off the heat. Stir in almond butter and salt with a hand whisk. Return the pan to the stove and simmer very gently, stirring the caramel for another minute to thicken the sauce a little bit \u2013 remember that it will thicken a bit more as it cools anyway. If it\u2019s too thick once cool, stir in a few drops of plant milk to bring the desired consistency back.

Be patient, it may seem like it will never turn to butter, but it will! It will go from clumps, to a ball against the side of the food processor (keep scraping the sides), then finally it will turn very creamy. If the mixture gets too hot, stop and let it cool down for a few minutes.\",\"4. Once the nut butter is very creamy, blend in the salt. If you wish to add additional flavors such as vanilla, cinnamon or honey, let the mixture cool, add the optional add ins and blend until creamy once again.

How long it takes will depend on how high your heat is and how wide\/shallow your pot is. Check with a measuring cup as you go until you have the correct volume. Set aside to cool to room temperature. This results in a viscous but pourable light caramel brown cream.\",\"2. *Note: if you make the condensed coconut milk the day before and refrigerate, you might need to bring it back closer to room temperature and thin with water to achieve a pourable consistency.\",\"3. First, preheat your oven to 350 \u00baF.\",\"4. In a stand mixer or with a handheld electric beater, lightly beat together the aquafaba and cream of tartar until frothy. Then turn up the speed until high and beat until you have stiff peaks. This takes 10 minutes with my stand mixer but could take longer on yours, and will take more time with a handheld electric mixer. You cannot over whip aquafaba, and if you do this too far in advance and it starts to deflate you can rewhip it back up to stiff peaks at any time.\",\"5.

Take a large scoop of the whipped aquafaba (about 1\/4-1\/3 of the mixture), and using a silicon spatula, gently fold the aquafaba to incorporate it evenly in the coconut mixture.

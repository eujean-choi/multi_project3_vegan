Use your palette knife to neaten the top and sides. If you have a side scraper, use it to sweep around the sides and top to sharpen the coating.

Slicing with the lines with the grain helps the onions soften (thanks, Thomas Keller). You should have about 12-13 cups (just over 3 quarts) of sliced onions.\",\"3. Heat the butter and olive oil in a heavy bottom pot or dutch oven over medium heat, coating the bottom. Add the onions and toss with the salt. Cover for 3-4 minutes.

While the onions are cooking toast the bread. Slice the baguette (2 slices per person) into 3\/8 inch slices, brush or spray with olive oil and sprinkle with salt.

Once onions begin to look caramel in color add the thyme. Increase heat to med or medium-high, and stir fairly constantly for 5-10 more minutes, until deeply golden. (You could do this ahead to this point and refrigerate.)\",\"6. Sprinkle the flour over the warm caramelized onions, stirring and toasting it for 1 minute. Add the broth, bay leaves and pepper. Stir, scraping up any browned bits and bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer uncovered for 10-15 more minutes.\",\"7. Add the 1\/4 teaspoon vinegar. Taste. Adjust salt and pepper- and if too salty for your taste, add a splash of water to dilute. Remove the bay leaves.\",\"8. If serving traditionally, in a ramekin, set oven to broil (or heat to 475F). Ladle the soup, 1\/2 inch from the rim. Top the warm soup with 2 toasted baguette slices slightly layered (do not sink them in, try to keep them afloat!) cover with sliced cheese, place on a sheet pan, repeat with the others and place sheet pan in the hot oven, baking until golden and bubbling. If broiling, keep a careful eye on them.\",\"9. Garnish with a sprig of thyme and serve immediately!\",\"10.

Add 150 ml (or \u00bd cup + 2 tbsp) of cold plant milk. Mix well with a spoon and then your hands. If the dough is not coming together and there are dry bits, add a touch more plant milk, teaspoon by teaspoon.

If using a mixer, add milk gradually while running the mixer on the lowest speed, until the dough comes together.\",\"3. Once the dough has stuck together, turn it out on to a work surface and knead until elastic and smooth \u2013 about 8 minutes by hand or for 3 minutes on a medium setting if using a mixer. This first phase of kneading is important as it allows the gluten to develop before you add fat, which hinders gluten development.\",\"4. Form the dough into a flat disc and pile some of the vegan butter on top of it, close the dough over the butter and start kneading adding more butter cubes as you go along. If using a mixer, add butter gradually while processing on the lowest speed. Occasionally, you may need to scrape the bowl down and reposition the dough.\",\"5. At this point the dough will be very slippery and messy and look like it\u2019s been ruined (see photos). It will come together again, but it needs to be patiently kneaded for about 20-25 minutes if kneading by hand or about 10 minutes if using a mixer.\",\"6. Once the dough has come together again, place in a lightly oiled bowl (oil the top of the dough ball too), cover with cling film and let it proof in the fridge overnight. Alternatively, you can allow it to rise in a warm place until it doubles in size (about 2-3 hrs).\",\"7. Just before you are ready to roll out your dough, melt chocolate and vegan block in a bowl suspended over a pot of barely simmering water. Sift in icing sugar, cocoa powder and salt and fold them in gently until you have a homogenous ganache.\",\"8. Roll the dough out, on a lightly floured surface, until you have a large rectangle measuring approximately 40 cm \/ 15.5 inches by 35 cm \/ 13.5 inches.\",\"9. Spread warm chocolate filling on the rolled out dough, leaving a 1.25 cm \/ 0.5 inch margin all over.\",\"10. Roll the dough into a tight snake along the shortest edge. When you almost finish the roll, paint a bit of water on the bit of dough that has no filling on it and close the roll firmly (that\u2019s important). First rim 2 cm \/ 1 \u201d off at both ends, then using a sharp knife, cut the snake in half lengthwise.\",\"11. Arrange the two strands of dough so that the cut sides face up. Criss cross one stand over the other in the middle, then twist the two strands again and again until you get a simple braid (see photos in my post).\",\"12. Tuck both ends in slighly and squeeze them with your hands gently so that they are well sealed.\",\"13.

Keep sealed pierogi under a damp kitchen towel to keep them moist and supple. Once you\u2019ve made about 10, boil 5 at a time for 5 minutes or longer depending on the thickness of your dough. Fish them out with a slotted spoon and place on a clean plate.\",\"8. If pan frying, allow pierogi to go completely cold first (storing them overnight in the fridge is ideal). Heat up a tablespoon of oil in a cast iron skillet (or a non-stick pan), lay cold pierogi on the pan and leave undisturbed for about 5 minutes. Allow them to blister on one side before flipping them to the other side and frying until browned and crisped up.\",\"9. To serve, slowly fry a small half an onion until translucent, season with salt and pepper. Serve warm pierogi coated in the onion-flavoured oil.

I used these mini tart cases so I lined them with pastry and trimmed to size, but I have also been testing making these in a standard 12-hole muffin tin. If that\u2019s what you have, use a large cookie cutter (I used my biggest 10 cm \/ 4\u2033 circle) to cut a neat circle out of the pastry and line the muffin hole with it. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the edges and making sure there is no air bubble underneath the pastry. The pastry won\u2019t quite reach the top of the muffin hole but that\u2019s okay. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin \u2013 you do not need to worry about overworking the pastry as it contains no gluten.\",\"9.

The best thing to use is a large zipper bag with the zip and bottom cut off and one of the sides split open. You can clean, dry and reuse this bag many times to minimise waste. Otherwise a piece of greaseproof paper also works, not as well as it tends to absorb some of the moisture out of the tortillas and its surface gets a bit crumpled in the process, but it does work. The size of this lining material depends on the size of your press \u2013 you don\u2019t want it to get caught in the hinges, but equally, you don\u2019t want it too small as the dough will spill out \u2013 I use a piece that when folded in the middle gives me a 19 cm \/ 7.5\u2033 square.\",\"2. TORTILLA PRESS\\nLine the tortilla press with your plastic or paper lining, place a dough ball a little off centre \u2013 closer to the main hinge than to the handle, put the second layer of your lining material down, close the press and the gently press down. You may want to rotate the tortilla 180 degrees, to ensure that it is evenly pressed as usually the part close to the handle gets a little flatter.\",\"3. NO TORTILLA PRESS\\nPlace a dough ball in the middle of the two layers of foil or paper and gently squash it with a heavy skillet or pan. Then use a rolling pin, through the lining material, to gently roll it out thinner if needed. Apply very delicate, even pressure with the rolling pin for best results.\"]},{\"COOKING\":[\"1. Have your tortilla warmer handy or prepare a contraption for keeping your tortillas warm and supple. A clean kitchen towel to wrap cooked tortillas in and something to lock the warmth in is what\u2019s needed \u2013 a small insulated cool bag, a dutch oven with a lid lined with bubble wrap etc., get creative.\",\"2. Heat up a comal or a heavy cast iron pan \/ skillet on a medium-high heat for about 3-4 minutes.\",\"3. Once the pan is hot, grab the first tortilla together with the lining foil \/ paper. Peel one layer of the lining foil off and place the tortilla flat in the palm of your hand, then peel the other side of the lining material off very slowly and gently.\",\"4. Lower your tortilla holding hand into the pan, flip your hand and allow the tortilla to fall flat onto the pan\u2019s surface.\",\"5. Leave the tortilla undisturbed for about 60 seconds so that the bottom side gets sealed \u2013 do that even if your tortilla doesn\u2019t quite land flat, it will be easier to take it off the pan cleanly.\",\"6. While your first tortilla is cooking, press another one and have it ready to place in the pan as soon as the first one is done.\",\"7. After 60 seconds, slide a spatula underneath the tortilla and flip it. Press it down with the spatula for a few seconds, at this point you may or may not have bubbles forming underneath the surface. Don\u2019t panic if they don\u2019t form, they don\u2019t always. Cook for 30-60 seconds. Then flip again and cook for another 30-60 seconds. As a rule of thumb, cook each tortilla for 2-3 minutes in total and while it\u2019s tempting to get it nicely charred, don\u2019t push it too much as your tortillas will end up dry and brittle.\",\"8. Once off the pan, place the cooked tortillas in a tortilla warmer (or your homemade equivalent). They will soften from the steam and remain warm and supple.\",\"9. Consume straight away, or store, wrapped tightly, for one 1-2 days. You can also freeze them separated by squares of baking paper and locked away in a freezer bag or an airtight container.

Designate a space in the middle of your dough and arrange a thin layer of dry spinach mixture there, a few dollops of vegan feta on top and some more spinach to cover the feta \u2013 be careful not to overfill the parcel though. Cut the very edges of the dough off to ensure the seams aren\u2019t thick and unpleasant to eat and fold the sides over the spinach rectangle like a parcel (being careful not to trap too much air inside).

Heat up a non-stick or griddle pan over a medium-low heat. Brush the first parcel with a little oil and place it, seam side down, on a pre-heated pan.

Brush the other side with a small amount of olive oil and turn the parcel over, again cook for a few minutes until the dough is just cooked. Proceed like this with the remaining 3 parcels.\",\"5.

If using maple syrup (or other liquid sweetener), use 60 ml \/ \u00bc cup less plant milk and add maple syrup to the milk before adding to the dry ingredients.\",\"3. Stir everything together with a large wooden spoon. You may need to add a tablespoon or so more milk if the mixture is too dry to stick together roughly at this point but do so very gradually. When the mixture has mostly stuck together turn the mixture out on to a work surface or bread\u00a0board.\",\"4. Knead the mixture by holding one end of the dough in one hand and stretching it out with the other hand. You then reform the dough, turn it 90 degrees and start again. Halfway through the kneading incorporate coconut oil (solid not melted) into the dough. It will make the dough slippery at first, you might think it has been ruined \u2013 but it has not, it will make for a richer dough. Keep on kneading and the dough will become elastic and smooth soon. In total the kneading should take about 15 minutes for this amount of dough.\",\"5. When the dough is smooth, form it into a ball and coat in a thin layer of oil. Place in a large mixing bowl and cover with a clean tea towel. Leave it in a warm place (but not too warm!) until it has doubled in size \u2013 about 1 hr. It\u2019s a good idea to take a photo of the dough at the beginning so that you are sure when it has doubled in volume. While the dough is proofing, make the filling (see FILLING section below).\",\"6. Once the dough has doubled in size, empty it out on to a work surface and push the air out with your fingertips.\",\"7. Roll the dough into a large rectangle that is about 36 cm \/ 14\u2033 wide. The height depends how swirly you want the buns, the thinner the dough the more swirls and therefore filling your buns will end up with \u2013 40 cm \/ 15\u00be\u201d height is what mine was.\",\"8. Spread a thin layer (you don\u2019t want the buns to end up soggy) of blended rhubarb all over the rolled out dough. Sprinkle evenly (!) with finely chopped candied ginger and raw rhubarb slices making sure they land on their sides for the most part.\",\"9. Starting from the bottom, roll the dough tightly so that you end up with a 36 cm \/ 14\u2033 long \u201cdough snake\u201d.\",\"10. Now, depending on your baking dish, divide the dough into 9 or 12 even (4-3 cm \/ 1.5 \u2013 1.1\u2033) segments. I find that a square or round dish, like mine, needs 9 and a rectangular one needs 12 pieces. Use a long piece of sewing thread to do the cutting as it does not squash the filling as much as a knife does. Place the thread under the snake and overlap the thread on the top of the snake where you want the cut to be, pull tight to cut.\",\"11. Place the segments, swirls face up, on a lightly oiled baking dish, leaving 1-2 cm between each bun. If you can fill the baking tray, this is ideal.\",\"12. Leave the buns (covered with a kitchen towel) to prove again for another hour. Toward the end of this time, preheat the oven to 175\u00b0 C \/ 350\u00b0 F.\",\"13. Brush the buns with the maple syrup + plant milk glaze and bake them for about 30-35 minutes, until golden brown. Cover the top with a piece of kitchen foil if you find that they are browning too quickly.\",\"14. While the buns are baking, create the icing by combining a tablespoon or so of the rhubarb puree with icing sugar and mixing really well. Adding more rhubarb puree will make the icing pinker but it will set a little looser.\\nTake the buns out of the oven when they are lovely and golden, and brush them with maple syrup (or sugar syrup) while they are still hot.\\nOnce they are cool, drizzle the rhubarb icing on top.\",\"15.

Toss the rhubarb segments in sugar (maple syrup or ginger stem syrup!) and bake until soft, it will take about 10 minutes (depending on the thickness).\",\"4.

Place the sheet of pastry in front of you so that the longer edge runs parallel to the work bench (I used a Jus Roll puff pastry sheet, which measures 23 cm \/ 9\u2033 by 35 cm \/ 13.5\u2033 cm). You will place your filling in the horizontal middle of the pastry. The width of the area designated for the filling is determined by the width of your butternut squash (mine was 8 cm \/ 3\u2033 wide).\",\"2. Mould some of the filling in a rectangle.\",\"3. Place the two halves of the butternut squash on top of the filling so that the cut ends touch each other in the centre \u2013 you may need to trim them so that they aren\u2019t longer than the filling area.\",\"4. Mould the rest of the filling over the butternut squash using your hands, making sure you compact the filling as you go along.\",\"5. Once the filling is in place, make a series of 2.5 cm \/ 1\u2033 diagonal incisions in the pastry on both sides of the stack to be able to create a braid at the top. See photos and video under this post for more details.\",\"6. Fold both end (top and bottom) flaps up, like you would wrap a present and then braid the strips over the top of the filling, alternating sides. If you end up with big gaps at either of the ends, patch them up with leftover pastry. This method works great here as it prevents slack in the pastry and allows for tight wrapping despite the slightly irregular shape of the filling. The tiny gaps in between the braids allow the steam to escape and prevents the vegetarian Wellington from bursting while in the oven.\",\"7. Brush the pastry with soy milk.\",\"8. Bake for about 50 minutes, until the pastry is beautifully puffed and golden. Serve with gravy and your favourite sides.\"]}]","recipe_id":1982,"serving":"serves 6-8","time":"60 min","title":"Vegetarian Wellington","total_fat":"29 g"},"355":{"calories":"166 kcal","carbs":"31 g","category":"3.Dessert+ Bread <Main ingredients: sugar\/milk\/coconut\/vanilla\/butter\/almond>","image":"https:\/\/cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/vegan-apple-strudel-whole-800x1200.jpg","ingredients":"[125 g \/ 1 cup all purpose flour, 1\/8 tsp salt, 25 g \/ 2 tbsp neutral tasting oil (I used coconut oil (melted), plus more to grease, approx. 60 ml \/ \u00bc cup warm water, 15 g \/ 1 tbsp neutral tasting oil (I used coconut oil (melted), 30 g \/ 3 tbsp breadcrumbs, toasted on a dry pan\n800 g \/ 28 oz apples (I recommend sour apples, like Bramley)\napprox. 100 g \/ \u00bd cup sugar (coconut sugar for refined sugar free version)\n1-1\u00bd tsp ground cinnamon, adjust to taste\n30 g \/ \u00bc cup raisins, soaked in boiling water for 10 min (optional)\nicing sugar, to decorate, 800 g \/ 28 oz apples (I recommend sour apples, like Bramley), approx. 100 g \/ \u00bd cup sugar (coconut sugar for refined sugar free version), 1-1\u00bd tsp ground cinnamon, adjust to taste, 30 g \/ \u00bc cup raisins, soaked in boiling water for 10 min (optional), icing sugar, to decorate]","link":"https:\/\/www.lazycatkitchen.com\/vegan-apple-strudel\/","pk":1984,"protein":"2 g","recipe":"[{\"DOUGH\":[\"1.

Set the oven to 200\u00b0 C \/ 390\u00b0 F (no fan).\",\"2. Pierce the clean potatoes all over with a skewer or a sharp knife. Place on a baking tray and bake for about 60 minutes (for medium size potatoes), turning to the other side halfway through (be sure to use kitchen gloves or kitchen tongs). They are ready as soon as a sharp knife slides in easily.\",\"3. While the potatoes are baking, prepare your work bench by cleaning it and sprinkling with a generous amount of flour.\",\"4. As soon as the potatoes come out of the oven, cut them in half. Put each half (skin on) into a potato ricer so that the cut side is right against the mesh. Rice the potatoes all over the prepared work bench area, spreading them a little (instead of placing all the flesh in one massive heap) so that more steam can escape as they cool.\",\"5. Once you are done with all the potatoes, you may want to go over the skins with a spoon, scooping the rest of the flesh and ricing it \u2013 I find that there is always a generous layer of potato flesh left.\",\"6. Sprinkle riced potatoes evenly with salt, nutmeg and half of the flour and then using a large knife (a pastry cutter or a bench scraper) cut the flour into the potatoes using a chopping motion.\",\"7. Next use your hands to knead the dough very gently as you do want a uniform dough to form, but you do not want to knead it too much as that will develop gluten in the flour and your gnocchi will be chewy. Keep on adding a little bit of flour at a time until the dough isn\u2019t sticky anymore. The less flour the better (produces lighter gnocchi) but too little flour will make them fall apart in cooking so don\u2019t go crazy. A good guide is about 10-15% flour compared to the weight of uncooked potatoes.\",\"8. Once you have a uniform dough that holds together well yet it is still very pliable, divide it into quarters. Roll each quarter into a long thin snake. Using a knife, cut the snake into same size pieces. Coat them lightly in flour.\",\"9. OPTIONALLY, you may want to ridge your gnocchi using the tines of a fork (or a gnocchi board if you own one), but that part is fairly time consuming, takes a while to get the hang of and it\u2019s not necessary, especially if you intend to serve them simply, in sage and garlic-flavoured olive oil. The idea is that the ridges help the gnocchi to hold more sauce, so if you are serving yours with a rag\u00f9, for example, you may want to spend the extra time. To ridge the gnocchi, roll each piece into a ball and then gently roll it against the back of the fork.\",\"10. Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Put a batch (say 20 \u2013 depends on the size of your pot) into the boiling water. Give the water a gentle stir and wait for the gnocchi to resurface (1-2 minutes). As soon as they come to the surface, scoop them up with a slotted spoon. Allow the excess water to drain away over the pot and place on a clean plate. Continue with the rest of your gnocchi.\",\"11. If you like your gnocchi pan-fried, allow them to cool down completely before frying or, even better, store them in the fridge overnight or else they will fall apart and turn into mush. I\u2019ve also tried frying them from raw (i.e. no prior boiling) and it does work but you need to fry them on a low heat and for a longer period of time to make sure the flour inside is fully cooked.\",\"12. To pan-fry your gnocchi, bring a non-stick pan to temperature, cover the bottom of the pan with olive oil, let the oil get hot and then throw cold gnocchi into the oil. Shake the pan to coat the gnocchi in oil and then leave undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until the bottoms of the gnocchi get caramelised. Toss the pan again and continue in the same manner until the gnocchi is golden on both sides. Serve with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, crushed hazelnuts and fried sage leaves (see below).\"]},{\"SAGE AND GARLIC OLIVE OIL (for boiled gnocchi)\":[\"1. Heat up a heavy bottom frying pan on a low heat. Once hot, add sage leaves. Allow them to fry for a few minutes (until stiff), then gently lift them out of the pan and place on a piece of paper towel. Sprinkle with salt and allow them to cool (they will crisp up).\",\"2. Add chopped garlic to the sage flavoured oil. Gently cook the garlic for about 2 minutes, stirring the whole time, but do not allow it to brown as it will taste bitter. If the garlic is sizzling too aggressively, turn the heat off (or take the pan off the heat if not using gas) and allow it to cook in the residual heat.\",\"3. Add nutritional yeast to the garlicky oil, a good pinch of salt and a splash of gnocchi cooking water and whisk until emulsified. If the sauce is too thin, allow the excess water to cook out until it reaches the desired consistency.\",\"4. Toss the drained gnocchi in the sauce well, season with salt and pepper, sprinkle with mild chilli (if using).\",\"5.

Rinse the cashews and chop them roughly. If you own a very powerful blender (like a Vitamix or Blendtec) this step may be completely redundant, but with my low-range (and fairly old) blender, this is the only way I can achieve a smooth consistency without adding too much liquid.\",\"2.

Once smooth, add another quarter of the chopped cashews. Process until smooth and repeat until you\u2019ve used up all of the cashews. Towards the end, the mixture will become very thick and heavy and your blender may struggle to turn. To remedy this, start making circles on the surface of your mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula to prevent air pockets forming under the mixture\u2019s surface. Be careful not to dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades.

Whisk in the smooth almond butter (I like to thin it out with a little almond milk separately first) and maple syrup and adjust the amount of plant milk to ensure the batter is the right consistency \u2013 it should be runny, but should coat the back of the spoon. I found that buckwheat flour requires more milk (approx. 600 ml \/ 2\u00bd cups) than plain flour or GF plain flour mix (approx. 480 ml \/ 2 cups), so please proceed with caution \u2013 it\u2019s easier to thin the batter than to thicken it.\",\"3.

Mix well and add about 120 ml \/ \u00bd cup of hot water. Once combined roughly with a wooden spoon, start bringing the dough together with your hands. If after a little bit of kneading the dough isn\u2019t holding together (initially it\u2019s supposed to be a bit dry to the touch but hold together), it may need a bit more hot water. It is very important to add the water in very small amounts\u00a0as too much water will negatively affect the dough. Knead it for about 5-10 minutes with your hands (after kneading, the dough should become very smooth and elastic, but not sticky) and then set aside for 30 minutes under\u00a0a damp kitchen towel so that the dough doesn\u2019t dry up.\",\"2. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, grab \u00bc of the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. You want it to be\u00a0about\u00a01-2 mm thin; the thinner the dough, the tastier the dumplings. With a cookie cutter or an upside down glass, cut out circles in the dough. Place less than a teaspoon of the filling in the centre of each circle, fold the circle in half and press the edges of the semi-circle together with your fingers. Go over each dumpling twice to make sure everything is sealed completely. Put the finished\u00a0dumplings on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a damp kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out. Continue in the same way until you\u2019ve used up all of the dough or the filling.\",\"3. Bring a medium pot of water to boil. Once the water is boiling, throw\u00a0in 10 dumplings at a time and from the moment the water comes to the boil again cook for 5 minutes (depending on how thick your dough is). Once the time is up, fish them out with a slotted spoon and place on a clean plate. Put a new batch in\u00a0until you have cooked\u00a0them all.\",\"4. OPTIONAL STEP: Heat up a little olive oil in a pan and place the cooled-down (they should be cold!) dumplings in the pan. Turn them after they\u2019ve browned on one side. Make sure you don\u2019t overcrowd the pan and do not turn the dumplings too early as they may start falling apart.\",\"5.

Using a butter knife, a supple spatula or simply your hands, cover the log with the rest of your duxelle mixture, making sure you compress the mixture gently as you go along (so that it doesn\u2019t fall off the log).\",\"7. Once the filling is in place, make a series of 2.5 cm \/ 1\u2033 incisions in the pastry on both sides of the stack at a slight diagonal (see photos in the post). The resulting strands of pastry will be braided at the top of our Wellington.\",\"8. Fold both end (top and bottom) flaps up, like you would wrap a present and then braid the strips over the top of the filling, alternating sides. If you end up with big gaps at either of the ends, patch them up with leftover pastry. The tiny gaps in between the braids allow the steam to escape and prevent the Wellington from bursting while in the oven.\",\"9. Brush the pastry with plant milk and sprinkle with coarse salt, sesame seeds or poppy seeds.\",\"10. Bake for about 35 minutes, until the pastry is beautifully puffed and golden.

Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out between two sheets of baking paper until you get a circle large enough to cover your entire tart case, about 2-3 mm in thickness.

Pierce the bottom of the pastry with a fork in a few places and chill the pastry-lined tart case in the fridge for about another 60 minutes.\",\"5. 45 min into pastry chilling time, preheat the oven to 175\u00b0 C \/ 350\u00b0 F.

Finally, gently fold in the almond meal, zest and almond essence with a spatula. You should end up with a thick batter (it will be a bit less thick if you used maple syrup instead of sugar).\",\"3. Fill the pastry case with almond frangipane and use a silicon spatula to spread the filling evenly. Place the fig quarters on top \u2013 don\u2019t worry about them sticking above the level of the filling \u2013 the filling will rise during baking a fair bit.\",\"4. Bake the tart for about 50-60 minutes, until the filling is nicely browned. I found that the maple syrup filling tends to take a little longer in the oven (by 10 minutes or so). Remove from the oven and allow the tart to cool down before removing it from the tin and cutting it into slices.

Divide the chopped cashews into six portions roughly. Chuck the first portion of chopped cashews into a blender with maple syrup, lemon juice and coconut milk (start off with 2 tbsp, add the 3rd later if needed). Process until super smooth.\",\"4. Once smooth, add another portion of the chopped cashews. Process until smooth and repeat until you\u2019ve used up all of the cashews. Towards the end, the mixture will become very thick and heavy and your blender may struggle to turn. To remedy this, start making circles on the surface of your mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula to prevent air pockets forming under the mixture\u2019s surface. Be careful not to dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades. If you follow the technique I\u2019ve described above, there should be enough moisture in this recipe not to have to use any extra liquid, which means you\u2019ll end up with a smooth, creamy and thick frosting.\",\"5.

Form the dough into a ball and rub a small amount of oil on the dough\u2019s surface to prevent drying.

Cut two circles (if you have a two tier bamboo steamer) of baking paper to line the steamer with. Make a lot of small holes in the circles so that the steam can get through.

Meanwhile, warm up \u00bd cup of coconut milk in a separate pot.\",\"2. Once all the sugar has melted, let the sugar caramelise and darken slightly (it will happen quite quickly so be careful not to burn it). The darker the caramel, the less sweet it will be. Once the sugar achieves the colour you are after, take the pan off the heat and slowly stir in the warmed up coconut milk and then add salt. Be very careful as even though warming milk up minimises this, caramel may be splattering at this point and it will be very hot.\",\"3. There is a chance that once you add the coconut milk, some of the caramel will harden into big lumps. What you need to do is to return the pan to the stove and set on a very low setting (I used 2 out of 6) to allow these lumps to melt away. Make sure you keep on stirring the mixture. Now, because the longer you cook your caramel sauce the more sticky and less sauce-like it will become, if you do need to bring it back to the stove to melt any stubborn lumps, add another \u00bc cup \/ 60 ml of coconut milk to the pan to ensure that once your lumps have dissolved the caramel will retain sauce consistency.

Meanwhile, warm up \u00bd cup of coconut milk in a separate pot.\",\"2. Once all the sugar has melted, let the sugar caramelise and darken slightly (it will happen quite quickly so be careful not to burn it). The darker the caramel the less sweet it will be.

Be very careful as even though warming milk up minimises this, caramel may be splattering at this point and it will be very hot.\",\"3. There is a chance that once you add coconut milk, some of the caramel will harden into big lumps. What you need to do is to return the pan to the stove and set on a very low setting (I used 2 out of 6) to allow these lumps to melt away. Make sure you keep on stirring the mixture. Now, because the longer you cook your caramel sauce the more sticky and less sauce-like it will become, if you do need to bring it back to the stove to melt any stubborn lumps, add another \u00bc cup \/ 60 ml of coconut milk to the pan to ensure that once your lumps have dissolved the caramel will retain sauce consistency.

Refrain from adding too much flour as it will produce dry tortillas. Once you are happy with the shape (they should be round*) and thickness (I roll mine quite thin), put your tortilla on a pan. Little bubbles should start to appear after about one minute. Do not wait until the bubbles go dark brown as that will make tortillas dry out too much and they\u2019ll crack later. After about 2 minutes (depends on how thick yours are) from when tortilla hit the pan, flip the tortilla and cook for only about 30 seconds on the other side. As soon as you are done, put the tortilla into the other pan and cover with damp kitchen towel. Continue the same way with all your tortillas.\",\"9.

To cut the brownies, heat up a knife by dipping it in some very hot water (from the kettle) and then drying it off with a towel and cutting. After each cut, dip the knife in the hot water and dry it off again, and repeat.

Turn the dough out onto the surface and divide it into 8 equal pieces (adjust amount if altering default number of servings). Shape each piece into a ball, adding a little flour to your hands if the dough is sticky. Then, shape each ball into a bagel by pressing your pointer finger into the middle of the ball and moving it in a circular motion to widen the hole. The hole of the bagel should be ~1 inch (2 \u00bd cm) in diameter, as it will shrink slightly when boiled. Dust your work surface once more so the formed bagels are easy to pick up.\",\"6. When the water reaches a rolling boil, carefully (we used a spatula) pick up each bagel and place it into the boiling water (we added 3 at a time). Boil each bagel for ~45 seconds per side, using a fork or tongs to flip each bagel. When ready to remove, use a skimmer or large slotted spoon to remove the bagel from the water, ensuring that all excess water drains off (we used a slotted spatula). Place the boiled bagel onto the prepared baking sheet and immediately top the bagel with 2 teaspoons of your preferred topping (if using). Repeat the process with the remaining bagels.\",\"7.

Begin smashing the raspberries with a wooden spoon until no large pieces remain, then add the maple syrup and arrowroot starch and stir to combine.\",\"10. Turn the heat up to medium-high and stir constantly until the mixture begins to bubble slightly. Lower the heat to medium (you want it steaming a bit, but not bubbling) and continue stirring for 5-10 minutes until the sauce begins to thicken and is a rich, red color. At this point, you can set it aside to cool or strain the seeds out using a fine mesh strainer for an extra smooth sauce (we prefer straining)! Let sauce cool completely before serving, and store in the refrigerator.\",\"11. When your cheesecake is baked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 20 minutes at room temperature, then transfer to the refrigerator (uncovered) to let cool completely. Once cooled, cover (waiting until cool will prevent condensation) and continue refrigerating for a total of 5-6 hours, preferably overnight.\",\"12. To serve, lift out of pan with parchment paper and cut into bars or triangles (we carefully cut off the very end pieces because they weren\u2019t as creamy as the center pieces.)

Remove corn husks from water and pat dry (when water remains on the husks, the masa can have a hard time adhering).

Add 2 \u2013 2 \u00bd Tbsp masa, then use the back of a spoon to spread the mixture from the bottom 1\/3 center of the husk to the right edge (see photo). Spread into a thin layer \u2014 somewhere between 1\/8th-inch and 1\/4-inch thick (not too thin or the fillings spill through, not too thick or the tamale takes longer to cook).\",\"11. Then add ~1 \u00bd Tbsp of the mashed sweet potatoes to the center of the masa and top with ~1 Tbsp of beans (see photo). Tuck the right side of the corn husk over the bean filling, right where the masa's left edge is. Then continue rolling until the seams meet. Then fold the narrow edge of corn husk over the seam and set in a loaf pan or dish that will keep your tamales upright. Continue until you have used all your masa mixture and filling (as original recipe is written, ~24 tamales).\",\"12. To a large pot or Dutch oven, add a steamer basket. Fill pot with water until it almost touches the base of the steamer basket. Then add the tamales, keeping them upright if possible (see photo).\",\"13. Turn heat to high, then, once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer to steam the tamales for about 1 hour. You\u2019ll know they\u2019re done when the masa appears cooked.

Take the next section and repeat, and move around the dough until you have created a tight ball. Then, turn the ball of dough and place seam side down on a clean, un-floured section of the counter. Cup the dough ball between your hands with your pinky fingers resting on the counter behind it. Pull the dough towards you, allowing the friction between the dough and counter to pull the dough underneath itself, and using your pinky fingers to prevent the dough from simply rolling. Turn the dough about a quarter turn and repeat. Do this until you've gone in a full circle and the skin around the dough ball is taught. Sprinkle flour over the dough and spread it around with your hands until the dough is not sticky to touch. Repeat with the remaining sections of dough, then place on a floured plate.

If the dough feels dry, drizzle in additional olive oil. If the dough feels wet and at all sticky, sprinkle on more flour. Form the dough into 1 tsp sized dumplings. You should make around 16-18 dumplings.\",\"5. When the soup reaches a low boil, add the dumplings to the soup. Let cook for around 5 minutes, stirring occasionally so they don\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pot. The dumplings will float to the top in about 4 minutes, and then let them cook about 1 additional minute before turning off the heat. Leave the pot covered to keep warm.\",\"6. While the dumplings are cooking, you can fry up the seitan bacon. Heat a large non-stick (such as cast iron) skillet over medium low heat. Add the oil when hot so that a thin film covers the entire pan. You can use less oil, for a less crispy result. Lay down a single layer of Sweet Earth Foods Benevolent Bacon and fry about 4 minutes, flipping every minute, or until the seitan bacon is a shade or two darker and the edges are a little black.

Let the dough rest, covered, for around 10 minutes to hydrate the flour, then knead a couple more minutes to check that it's the correct texture. The dough should be firm and not sticky or tacky, but still be pliable.\",\"3. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 30 minutes. If resting more than 1 hour, place in fridge. The dough can be made up to 24 hours before rolling.\",\"4. When ready to roll the dough, divide into 3 or 4 portions (if this is your first time working with pasta dough separate into 4 portions, but as you get more confident 3 makes it go faster). Work with one piece of dough at a time, and keep the others wrapped tightly in plastic so they don't dry out.\",\"5. Roll the section of dough with a rolling pin until it's long and rectangular and around 1\/4\\\" thin. Then take that strip of dough and feed it through a pasta roller at the thickest setting. Run it through that setting at least 3 times, until it runs through easily and is no longer pressing the dough. Then, turn the knob so that the pasta roller is one setting thinner. Repeat the process of running the dough through the roller around 3 times until it's not getting pressed. Set the roller one setting thinner and repeat once more.\",\"6. Take the dough and place it on the counter. Fold the sides of the dough into the center to meet. Then fold in half. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough in the opposite direction of the fold to create a neat rectangle. Then, repeat the process of running the dough through the thickest three settings of the pasta roller, starting with the thickest setting and running through a couple of times before turning to the thinner setting and so on. Run the dough with the thinner side going in first and rolling down the wider side, this is the opposite direction you were rolling the dough previously.\",\"7. Repeat the folding of the dough on the counter, and rolling perpendicular to the fold once more. Now feed the dough through the machine on the thickest setting once more, and work one setting at a time until you get to the 4th or 3rd from the thinnest setting. For linguini or fettuccini I prefer leaving my noodles a bit thicker and typically go for the 4th setting. For making a stuffed pasta like ravioli or tortellini I go to the 3rd or maybe even 2nd thinnest setting, as the edges get doubled up on.\",\"8. Lay the finished sheet of pasta on a parchment lined baking sheet and cover with a towel.\",\"9. Repeat this process with the remaining sections of dough. It should go fairy quickly once you have the hang of it.\",\"10. Once you have your sheets of dough, dust them with some flour and cut into the desired shapes. You can use a machine to cut into spaghetti or thicker noodles like linguini, or you can cut by hand to whatever width you desire. Toss the noodles in more flour if they are at all sticky. Cover until ready to cook. You can cook immediately or leave the noodles out to dry for an hour before cooking. You can flour the somewhat dried noodles well before transferring to a sealed container and putting in the fridge for a few hours or a day before cooking. If waiting longer than a day, place in the freezer.\",\"11. To cook the noodles, bring a pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the noodles to the pot and cook for 1-2 minutes. Depending on the size of the noodles you may need less time, such as if you make spaghetti. Begin checking for doneness after 30 seconds. Be careful, the noodles can go from done to over cooked quickly. For my linguini style of noodles 90 seconds seems to work perfectly.\",\"12. Drain the noodles and toss in your favorite pasta sauce, or with some olive oil and vegan parmesan cheese. Taste before adding salt, as the noodles might not need any more.

To knead with a stand mixer: Using the dough hook, turn mixer to lowest speed and let knead for 3 minutes. Turn off mixer and let the dough rest for 5 minutes. Then turn back on low and let knead an additional 3 minutes. Turn the dough onto a clean, lightly floured surface and knead for 1 minute adding flour or water if necessary. The dough should be lightly tacky but not sticky, if too sticky add more flour and if not at all tacky wet your hands and knead the water into the dough.\",\"3. To knead by hand: Knead dough by hand for three minutes, beginning in the bowl until it forms a nice uniform mass, then transferring to a clean, lightly floured surface. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then knead an additional 3-4 minutes. In the last minute of kneading add water or flour as necessary to create a lightly tacky but not sticky dough.\",\"4. Place dough into a lightly oiled large mixing bowl and turn the dough ball, cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 4 days. If you are going to bake in batches, divide before refrigerating and place each batch into a separate bowl.\",\"5. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions (~108g each), there is no need to flour the counter as it should not stick. Working gently to deflate as little as possible, form the dough into balls by forming a rough round shape. On a clean surface, with the seam side facing down, cup your hand over the ball of dough and make a small circular motion. This will pull the outside of the dough around and under and create a tight skin around the dough ball. There will be a seam at the bottom of the ball, if your dough is a bit dry the seam will not close (don't worry about it, just keep going with the process--it will turn out fine!), but if it's at the correct hydration the seam will mostly close up.\",\"6. Place the formed balls of dough onto a lightly greased parchment lined baking sheet, seam side down. Spray the tops with oil and lightly cover with plastic wrap. Leave to rise for 1 - 1 1\/2 hours until about doubled in size. To check that they are fully proofed and ready for their baking soda bath and baking, poke the dough with your finger to create an indentation (poke the side or bottom to not mar the top of your bun!). If fully proofed, it will only spring back ~25%. If it springs back almost all the way quickly the dough needs more time, and if it doesn't spring back at all you've over proofed and work as quickly as possible to get the dough in the oven. Pop the baking sheet into the fridge if you need to.\",\"7. About 45 minutes before the dough is ready to bake, preheat your oven to 400 \u00baF and place a rack in the center of the oven.\",\"8. When the buns are fully proofed, prepare the baking soda bath. Add the 2 quarts of water into a large stock pot and bring to a boil. When boiling add the baking soda and salt. Working with 3-4 buns at a time (don't over crowd the pot!), boil 30-60 seconds on each side. Remove with a slotted spoon and return to baking sheet. Repeat until all buns are boiled. If you would like to score the tops of the buns use a sharp knife and cut an X pattern into the top. This is optional.\",\"9. For a little extra shine, brush the tops of the buns with a little non-dairy milk right before baking.\",\"10. Bake the buns for 12 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet for even baking, and bake an additional 8-10 minutes. The buns are done when they are a deep golden color. Let cool at least 20 minutes before using.\",\"11. If you don't finish them on the first day, slice open the buns then pop them into a freezer bag.

Sprinkle the salt and yeast over the top of the dough. Using wet hands, incorporate the salt and yeast by reaching under the edges of the dough and gently pulling it up and away from the sides of the bowl, then folding the dough to rest on top of salt mixture. Give the bowl 1\/4 turn and repeat, until you've pulled and folded the dough over all the salt and yeast to cover. Next, pinch the dough into several segments between your first finger and thumb. Then repeat the folding process to bring the dough back together to one piece. Repeat this segmenting and folding a couple more times until the salt is well distributed. Rewet your hands as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking. All in all, this process will only take 1-2 minutes. Leave the dough to rest for around 10 minutes, covered.\",\"5. After ~10 minutes, sprinkle the toasted walnuts overtop, and incorporate with wet hands using the same method you used to add the salt and yeast.

After incorporating the walnuts and letting the dough rest for 20 minutes you will apply the first fold. Using wet hands and the same process you did to fold dough over the salt and nuts, you will reach your hands under a section of the dough, lift gently so not to tear the dough, and place it over top the rest of the dough. Turn the bowl slightly and repeat around 4 times until you have a nice ball in the bowl. Rotate the ball so the seam is touching the bowl. Let rest for 30 minutes. Repeat the folding. Rest another 30 minutes and fold for the last time. Leaving the seam down, let the dough rise at room temperature at least another 30 minutes (no longer if your kitchen is much warmer than 70 \u00baF).\",\"8. Move the dough to the fridge and leave overnight, or no longer than 36 hours.\",\"9. One hour before you are ready to bake the bread, preheat the oven to 475 \u00baF with your high heat safe dutch oven inside.\",\"10. While the oven is preheating, shape your bread.\",\"11. First prepare either a proofing basket or a large mixing bowl. If using a proofing basket, simply generously flour the basket and use your hands to distribute the flour around the bowl. If using a large mixing bowl, line it with a lint free towel, and then generously sprinkle flour onto the towel.\",\"12. Lightly flour a clean work surface, and gently ease the dough (so not to allow the gases formed to escape) onto the counter. Gently ease the dough into a large rough circle (the shape isn't important), being careful not to tear the dough. To shape the dough, you will begin with the same folding technique (this time with dry or lightly floured hands). Take a section of the dough and gently stretch it up until you feel resistance, then fold over the middle. Take the next section and repeat, and move around the dough until you have created a tight ball.\",\"13. Take the ball of dough and move over to an unfloured section of the counter. With the dough sitting on the counter seam side down, cup the dough ball between your hands with your pinky fingers resting on the counter behind it. Pull the dough towards you, allowing the friction between the dough and counter to pull the dough underneath itself, and using your pinky fingers to prevent the dough from simply rolling. Turn the dough about a quarter turn and repeat. Do this until you've gone in a full circle and the skin around the dough ball is taught. Sprinkle flour over the dough and spread it around with your hands until the dough is not sticky to touch. Then place the ball of dough into the prepared proofing basket or mixing bowl seam side down. Dust a little extra flour over top, then cover with a towel and leave to rise for ~60 minutes (If your kitchen is very warm you may only leave it for 45 minutes).\",\"14. To check the dough is ready for the oven, dip your finger first in a little flour, then poke the dough about 3\/4\\\". If the indentation springs up slightly but then stops, leaving a smaller indentation, the dough is ready to bake. If it springs up almost 100% right away then it needs more time. If the dough doesn't spring back at all, it is overproofed, but that's ok, still bake it, just get it to the oven as quickly as possible.\",\"15. When the dough passes the indentation test, it's time to bake. Using oven mitts, carefully remove the dutch oven and take the lid off. Turn the proofing basket upside down on to a floured surface and tap the basket to release the dough. You should see some cracks on the top of the dough (where the seams were), this is where the dough will expand and crack and where the height of the loaf comes from.\",\"16. Using two hands, carefully lift the dough and drop it into the dutch oven (be careful of burning yourself!). Cover the pot and place it into the oven. Bake for 30 minutes covered. After 30 minutes, carefully remove the lid, turn the heat down to 450 \u00baF and bake an additional 20 minutes. You can bake longer for a darker crust, or slightly less time for a lighter crust.\",\"17. When you have reached your desired crust, remove the pot from the oven and turn the bread out. Place it on a cooling rack and allow to cool for at least 20-30 minutes before slicing into. It finishes baking outside of the oven in these last minutes.\",\"18. Enjoy your bread!\",\"19. To store, place cut side down on a cutting board, never place it in fridge, and do not put in a plastic bag.
